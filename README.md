Stress is a common factor in our daily lives and has a significant impact on our mental and physical well-being. 
It is a known fact that individuals with bipolar disorder are more susceptible to stress and its effects. In this study, a 
neural network was used to analyze the difference in stress levels between normal individuals and individuals with 
bipolar disorder using EEG signals. The EEG signals were collected and processed, and the results were fed into a 
neural network for analysis. The study found that there was a significant difference in stress levels between normal 
individuals and those with bipolar disorder. The results showed that individuals with bipolar disorder had higher 
levels of stress compared to normal individuals. This study provides valuable insights into the physiological 
differences between normal and bipolar individuals under stress and can be useful in developing new diagnostic and 
therapeutic techniques. The findings of this study also highlight the importance of early detection and effective 
management of stress in individuals with bipolar disorder.
